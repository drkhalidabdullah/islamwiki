echo "✅ Language system now user-specific\n";
echo "✅ When not logged in: defaults to English\n";
echo "✅ When user logs in: loads their language preference\n";
echo "✅ When user logs out: resets to English\n";
echo "✅ Language preferences stored in user's profile\n";
echo "✅ Each user has their own language setting\n\n";

echo "🎯 Expected Behavior:\n";
echo "=====================\n";
echo "• Not logged in: Always shows English\n";
echo "• User logs in: Shows their saved language preference\n";
echo "• User changes language: Saves to their profile\n";
echo "• User logs out: Resets to English\n";
echo "• Different users: Each has their own language\n";
echo "• Language persists per user across sessions\n\n";

echo "9. Verify language is Arabic (saved preference)\n";
echo "10. Login as different user (if available)\n";
echo "11. Verify they have their own language setting\n\n";

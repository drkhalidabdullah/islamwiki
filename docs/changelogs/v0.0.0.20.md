## üêõ **Critical Bug Fixes**

### Z-Index Resolution
**Issue:** Tag people and feeling/activity buttons in dashboard were not clickable due to z-index conflicts.

**Root Cause:** Header dashboard had z-index: 10001, but modals only had z-index: 1000, causing the header to cover the modals.

**Solution:** Updated all modal z-index values to 10002:
- Modal styles: `1000` ‚Üí `10002`
- Comment modal: `10000` ‚Üí `10002`
- Fullscreen mode: `1000` ‚Üí `10002`
- Help modal: `1000` ‚Üí `10002`

### User Name Color Fix
**Issue:** User name in header dashboard was not displaying as white.

**Solution:** Added `!important` declaration to ensure proper color display:
```css
.user-name {
    color: #ffffff !important;
}
```
